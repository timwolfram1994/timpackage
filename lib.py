                    one thing.

                    You know how this is:
                    if I look
                    at the crystal moon, at the red branch
                    of the slow autumn at my window,
                    if I touch
                    near the fire
                    the impalpable ash
                    or the wrinkled body of the log,
                    everything carries me to you,
                    as if everything that exists,
                    aromas, light, metals,
                    were little boats
                    that sail
                    toward those isles of yours that wait for me. """
